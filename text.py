# üëã Welcome to the introduction app!
    
With VIKTOR, you can simplify engineering, design, and data science tasks through digital automation tools.

In this app, we'll walk you through the potential of automation using an example: designing a simple building. As you follow along, consider how these automation techniques could benefit your work, bearing in mind that the building example is just one application.

# üìç Interactive maps

VIKTOR empowers you to create dynamic maps showcasing points, lines, areas, and data from databases or calculations. Furthermore, users can ask users to draw on the map and use that data for the next step.

### Building design example:

In this example, we'll use the map to define where we want to place the building and calculate the cost of the terrain.

# üè¨ Parametric 3D models

Whether you're involved in the design of structures like buildings, bridges, tunnels, or any other project, chances are you're working with a 3D model to help your design decisions.

VIKTOR offers the capability to develop 3D models that seamlessly adjust whenever you modify a parameter. These models can be the basis for cost assessments and various calculations, such as structural and geotechnical analyses.

Furthermore, you can effortlessly generate models using Grasshopper or Dynamo, and visualize files in formats like IFC, glTF, and GLB.

### Building design example:
In this example, we used the information you selected on the map to generate the 3D model of the building and the terrain surrounding it. Just change the building parameters and see what happens.

# üîó Integrate software

Chances are, you're already utilizing specialized software in your daily workflows, such as design tools or software for structural, geotechnical, or hydraulic calculations.

With VIKTOR, seamless integration with your preferred software solution and the entire Python ecosystem becomes a reality. This enables you to streamline and automate any aspect of your workflow that suits your needs.

### Building design example

To provide an example, we can link an FEM package such as SCIA to assess building forces, connect it to IdeaStatica for reinforcement calculations, and integrate PLAXIS for geotechnical assessments.

With all these elements seamlessly interconnected, we can perform hundreds of calculations and present the results on this app, assisting you in identifying the optimal design.

But hey, remember, we're keeping things simple here üòâ

# üìà Data visualization

Making attractive plots is the key to showing off data. In VIKTOR you can use Plotly to create and visualise all types of graphs and animations. 

These charts and graphs in VIKTOR are interactive, easy to set up, and can be integrated with other Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and many more.

Thanks to a rich variety of graphs and a well-written documentation, your charts will look right at home in your VIKTOR apps.

### Building design example
For any building, one of the most abundant materials used is concrete. As the engineer of this project you must select some concrete types to add to the report.
The trade-off between strength, cost and CO2 output is one that must be carried out carefully and with the building requirements in mind.
By plotting the properties in a Bar chart, concretes can be compared to each other. 
You may have already spotted that the cost per unit strength is a reason to consider a stronger concrete, however it does increase the CO2 output significantly.

# üìù Generate custom reports

Making reports from scratch or keeping them up-to-date is often a tedious and time-consuming task. Gathering data, images, and crafting a report can eat up hours, not to say that we need to start all over again when the design changes. 

Thankfully, a solution exists. With VIKTOR, you can effortlessly automate the creation of personalized reports using your own Word or Excel templates. This includes adding text, tables, images, and drawings, saving you both time and effort.


### Building design example:
Continuing with our building design example, we will use the information generated during the design process to create a report. But before we do that, we need some information:

Here we have added your inputs, an API response (location data) and the calculations to the report to show you how effortless reporting can be.
